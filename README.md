# DNT stage 1

Cuz github told me to make a README.....

Task 1:
Use of Python and turtle to make a pattern

Inspiration taken from childhood memories of a spirograph.
Enjoy ;)


Task 2:
Use of opencv to skip 75% of the frames of the input video.

Sadly couldnt finish the code successfully though the logic looks correct to me, would love to know what I was doing wrong, ty.
